# Requirements for the new system

TODO: A big chunck of text and diagrams to explain what features are important and what use cases should be covered.

## Open questions

So I don't forget those in the requirement analysis

- What does the reusing feature do? Why are some of the SKUs prefixed with R and a number?
- Difference between readers & normal glasses? And do you use/need the readers feature currently? That was a bit unclear from the manual.
- New Donations are only entered between the annual visits right? You usually don't need to enter glasses while you're in other countries?
- Do you (or the other orgs using the software) have good internet connections where you work/dispense the glasses?
- I already understood that the ability to enter new data "simultaneously" into the database is pretty important for you?
