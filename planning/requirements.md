# Requirements for the new system

TODO: A big chunck of text and diagrams to explain what features are important and what use cases should be covered.

## Use cases

1. Entering new Rx

   - New Donations are only entered between the annual visits right? You usually don't need to enter glasses while you're in other countries?
   - Who does this? How are SKUs allocated/shared?
   - What types of glasses exist and which attrs to they have? Difference between readers & normal glasses? And do you use/need the readers feature currently?
   - Is it done by keyboard only? How are glasses measured (digitally)?
   - What does the reusing feature do? Why are some of the SKUs prefixed with R and a number? Is there a reason why it's limited to 10k?

2. Matching glasses on site (and dispensing them)

   - Who does this? How are people measured? What does their exact workflow look like? How is the dispensing feature used?
   - Is the algorithm available/public?
   - Should it be done simultanously? Is it advantagous to enter it via mobile?
   - Internet connection?

3. Generate reports (after a campaign)

   - What numbers are important? Is this feature only used after a campaign?
   - Who does this?

4. General stuff

   - Security concept: Is it okay for the data to be publically available? In any case, a write account is neccessary? How to add new write users?
