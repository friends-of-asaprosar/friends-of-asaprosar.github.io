# Ideas and notes for the new system

This is a page for all the ideas I had while exploring the current version of REIMS. Most of them are just nice-to-have and could be done after the rewrite as a QOL improvement.

- Split the application into features:

  - Entering new Rx (online connection required),
  - Searching & dispensing (must work without full connection)
  - Generating reports after a campaign (maybe Grafana or sth like that)

- Two kinds of prescriptions (Rx): readers & glasses

- QR Code and prescription printing feature?

## Database design
